            <p>A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during
                the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear
                fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or
                is completely destroyed. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an
                entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.Supernovae are more energetic than novae. In
                Latin, nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.
                Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous.

            <p>The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1929. The most recent directly observed
                supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of more recent supernovae
                have been found. Observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on
                average about three times every century. These supernovae would almost certainly be observable with
                modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A, the explosion of a
                blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way.Theoretical studies
                indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of
                nuclear fusion in a degenerate star such as a white dwarf, or the sudden gravitational collapse of a
                massive star's core. In the first class of events, the object's temperature is raised enough to trigger
                runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. Possible causes are an accumulation of material
                from a binary companion through accretion, or a stellar merger. In the massive star case, the core of a
                massive star may undergo sudden collapse once it is unable to produce sufficient energy from fusion to
                conteract the star's own gravity. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two
                simplified theories, the astrophysical mechanics are established and accepted by the astronomical
                community.

            <p>Supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of
                light. This drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an
                expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of
                elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can
                trigger the formation of new stars. Supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays.
                Supernovae might produce gravitational waves, though thus far, gravitational waves have been detected
                only from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. Astronomers classify supernovae according to
                their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra.
                If a supernova's spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series in the visual portion
                of the spectrum) it is classified Type II; otherwise it is Type I. In each of these two types there are
                subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a
                graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of time).
