        <p align="left">A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e.,
            different locations, different points in time, or both).

            Theoretically, a wormhole might connect extremely long distances such as a billion light years, or short
            distances such as a few meters, or different points in time, or even different universes.

            In 1995, Matt Visser suggested there may be many worm holes in the universe if cosmic strings with negative
            mass were generated in the early universe.Some physicists, such as Frank Tipler and Kip Thorne, have
            suggested how to make wormholes artificially.</p>

                The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow
                effective superluminal (faster-than-light) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded
                locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used.
                If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them outside
                the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to
                make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole. However, a light beam
                traveling through the same wormhole would beat the traveler.

                <font size="6" color="white"><u>Time travel:</u></font>
                If traversable wormholes exist, they might allow time travel.[27] A proposed time-travel machine using a
                traversable wormhole might hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is
                accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion
                system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance
                of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than
                the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance.
                For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the worm hole that has been moved to have aged
                less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time
                connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of
                the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no
                matter how the two ends move around.[33]: 502  This means that an observer entering the "younger" end
                would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going
                back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine
                is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;[33]: 503 
                It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it
                would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.

            <font color="white">What exactly is a 'wormhole'? Have wormholes been proven to exist or are they still
                theoretical?<br>

                Wormhole is the actual solution to the Einstein field equations for gravity that act as "tunnels,"
                connecting points in space-time in such a way that the trip between the points through the wormhole
                could take much less time than the trip through normal space...

                Theorists have since found other wormhole solutions; these solutions connect various types of geometry
                on either mouth of the wormhole. One amazing aspect of wormholes is that because they can behave as
                "shortcuts" in space-time, they must allow for backwards time travel! This property goes back to the
                usual statement that if one could travel faster than light, that would imply that we could communicate
                with the past.</font>
