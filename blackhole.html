            <h3>BlackHole</h3>

            <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing ‚Äì no particles or even
                electromagnetic radiation such as light ‚Äì can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts
                that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of no escape is
                called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object
                crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a
                black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in
                curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black
                body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths
                of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

            <p>üî≥How Do Black Holes Form?
                Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made
                when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a
                supernova. A SUPERNOVA is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think
                supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.

            <h3>Formation of Black Hole</h3>

            <p>üî≥What is the structure of a black hole?
                The singularity constitutes the center of a black hole, hidden by the object‚Äôs ‚Äúsurface,‚Äù the event
                horizon. Inside the event horizon, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light so that not even rays
                of light can escape into space.

            <h3>Structure of Black Hole</h3>

            <p>üî≥How Big Are Black Holes?
                Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one
                atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of
                matter, or "stuff," in an object. Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to
                20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's
                galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These
                black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that
                every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the
                center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and
                would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.

            <h3>Giant Black hole 660 million times bigger than Sun</h3>

            <p>üî≥What are some examples of black holes?
                One example of a black hole is can be found in Cygnus X-1, a binary X-ray system consisting of a blue
                supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun. Another example is Sagittarius A*,
                a supermassive black hole that exists at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.
