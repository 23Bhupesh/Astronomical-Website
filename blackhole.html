                <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing ‚Äì no particles or even
                    electromagnetic radiation such as light ‚Äì can escape from it. The theory of general relativity
                    predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of
                    no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances
                    of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In
                    many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum
                    field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same
                    spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of
                    the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to
                    observe directly.</p>

                <p>üî≥How Do Black Holes Form? <br>Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe
                    began.
                    Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses.
                    When this happens, it causes a supernova. A SUPERNOVA is an exploding star that blasts part of the
                    star into space.
                    Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.</p>

                <p>üî≥What is the structure of a black hole?<br>
                    The singularity constitutes the center of a black hole, hidden by the object‚Äôs ‚Äúsurface,‚Äù the event
                    horizon. Inside the event horizon, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light so that not even
                    rays of light can escape into space.</p>

                <p>üî≥How Big Are Black Holes?<br>Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black
                    holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large
                    mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff," in an object.
                    Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of
                    the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is
                    called the Milky Way.
                    The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more than
                    1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive
                    black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is
                    called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large
                    ball that could hold a few million Earths.</p><br>

                <p>üî≥What are some examples of black holes?<br>
                    One example of a black hole is can be found in Cygnus X-1, a binary X-ray system consisting of a
                    blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun. Another example is
                    Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that exists at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
