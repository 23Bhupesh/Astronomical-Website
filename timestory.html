            <h1>Story Time From Space: In-Orbit Readings and Science to Encourage STEM in the Classroom</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>“Welcome to the International Space Station,” said NASA astronaut and microbiologist Kate Rubins as she
                welcomed students to the orbiting laboratory – or library – for a reading of “Rosie Revere, Engineer”
                during an Expedition 49 Story Time From Space. Story Time From Space is an investigation that aims to
                inspire students, educators and families to actively engage in Science, Technology, Engineering and
                Mathematics (STEM) programs through the excitement of space exploration and literacy.
            </p><br>

            <p>Together with NASA and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), Story Time From Space
                arms formal and informal educators with the necessary materials and knowledge to teach fun, accurate
                STEM lessons. “To help support educators, we are taking all the wonderful content we are getting down
                from orbit and putting it into curriculum and professional development workshops so we can work with
                educators to help them feel confident and have the science background to teach the concepts correctly,”
                said Patricia Tribe, educator and co-founder of Story Time From Space.

            <p>With a library of 15 titles, and five more on the way, crew members are able to share their love for
                science and space exploration through books such as “Max Goes to the Space Station,” “Mousetronaut,”
                “Endeavour’s Long Journey” and “The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home.” Crew members send
                prerecorded video of themselves reading the books aloud from the space station or performing a science
                experiment that goes along with concepts mentioned within the books.
            </p><br>

            <p>Nine experiments join the books aboard the station, weaving together literacy and STEM concepts. “The
                science experiments in our Science Time From Space element deal with basic science concepts that all
                kids are required to learn in school,” said Tribe. Concepts include balance, buoyancy, surface tension,
                orbits, light, heat transfer, free-fall, pendulous motion and the human body.

            <p>Each of the books were chosen with input from authors, educators, publishers and educational
                organizations such as the National Science Teachers Association, with an emphasis placed on each story’s
                scientific accuracy. “How many people have to unlearn and relearn a concept as we get older because we
                were not taught accurately?” said Tribe. “We wouldn’t teach the alphabet incorrectly so why are we ok
                with it happening in STEM?”
            </p><br>
            
            <p>Story Time From Space has taken a step toward arming educators with the knowledge and confidence needed
                to accurately teach the next generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts in STEM subjects by
                providing high-quality, engaging material for them to share with their students. Story Time From Space
                has reached further than just the classroom, engaging libraries, community centers, home schools and
                afterschool programs in STEM activities. Soon, Story Time From Space will offer curriculum development
                and professional development materials.
