                what is Quantum Computing?
            </h2>

            <img class=" img quantCompImg1" src="images/quantumComputingIMg1.jpg" alt="quantum computing image">

            <p>Quantum computing is an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on the
                principles of quantum theory (which explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and
                subatomic levels). Computers used today can only encode information in bits that take the value of 1 or
                0—restricting their ability.
            </p><br>

            <p>Quantum computing, on the other hand, uses quantum bits or qubits. It harnesses the unique ability of
                subatomic particles that allows them to exist in more than one state (i.e., a 1 and a 0 at the same
                time).
            </p><br>

            <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</h2>
            <p>1.Quantum computing is the study of how to use phenomena in quantum physics to create new ways of
                computing.
                2.Quantum computing is made up of qubits.
                3.Unlike a normal computer bit, which can be 0 or 1, a qubit can be either of those, or a superposition
                of both 0 and 1.
                4.The power of quantum computers grows exponentially with more qubits.
                5.This is unlike classical computers, where adding more transistors only adds power linearly.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Understanding Quantum Computing</h2>

            <p>Superposition and entanglement are two features of quantum physics on which these supercomputers are
                based. This empowers quantum computers to handle operations at speeds exponentially higher than
                conventional computers and at much lesser energy consumption. The field of quantum computing started in
                the 1980s. It was then discovered that certain computational
                problems could be tackled more efficiently with quantum algorithms than with their classical
                counterparts.
            </p><br>

            <p>Quantum computing could contribute greatly in the fields of finance, military affairs and intelligence,
                drug design and discovery, aerospace designing, utilities (nuclear fusion), polymer design, machine
                learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data search, and digital manufacturing.

                Its potential and projected market size have engaged some of the most prominent technology companies to
                work in the field of quantum computing, including IBM, Microsoft, Google, D-Waves Systems, Alibaba,
                Nokia, Intel, Airbus, HP, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, SK Telecom, NEC, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Rigetti,
                Biogen, Volkswagen, and Amgen.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Quantum Computer vs. Classical Computer</h2>

            <p>Quantum computers process information differently. Classical computers use transistors, which are either
                1 or 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be 1 or 0 at the same time. The number of qubits linked
                together increases the quantum computing power exponentially. Meanwhile, linking together more
                transistors only increases power linearly.
            </p><br>

            <img class=" img quantCompImg3" src="images/quantumComputingIMg2.jpg" alt="quantum computing image">

            <p>Classical computers are best for everyday tasks that need to be completed by a computer. Meanwhile,
                quantum computers are great for running simulations and data analyses, such as for chemical or drug
                trials. These computers must be kept ultra-cold, however. They are also much more expensive and
                difficult to build.
            </p><br>

            <p>Classical computing advances include adding memory to speed up computers. Meanwhile, quantum computers
                help solve more complicated problems. While quantum computers might not run Microsoft Word better or
                faster, they can run complex problems faster. For example, Google’s quantum computer that’s in
                development could help with many processes, such as speed up machine-learning training or help create
                more energy-efficient batteries.
            </p><br>

            <p>Quantum computing has a number of other applications, including securely sharing information. Other
                methods include fighting cancer and various health concerns, such as cancer and developing new drugs. As
                well, quantum computers can help improve radars and their ability to detect such things as missiles and
                aircraft. Other areas include the environment and using quantum computing to keep the water clean with
                chemical sensors.

            <h2>Real-World Example of a Quantum Computer</h2>

            <p>Google (GOOG) is spending billions of dollars on its plan to build its quantum computer by 2029. The
                company has opened a campus in California, called Google AI, to help it meet its goal. Google has been
                investing in this technology for years. As well, so have other companies, such as Honeywell
                International (HON) and International Business Machine (IBM). IBM expects to hit major quantum computing
                milestones in the coming years.
            </p><br>

            <p>While some companies have built personal (although expensive) quantum computers, there is still nothing
                available on the commercial side. And there’s interest in quantum computing and its technology, with
                JPMorgan Chase and Visa looking into the technology. Once developed, Google could launch a quantum
                computing service via the cloud.
            </p><br>

            <p>Companies can also gain access to quantum technology without having to build a quantum computer. IBM
                plans to have a 1,000-quibit quantum computer in place by 2023. For now, IBM allows access to its
                machines if they’re part of its Quantum Network. Those that are part of the network include research
                organizations, universities, and laboratories.6 Microsoft also offers companies access to quantum
                technology via the Azure Quantum platform. This is unlike Google, which doesn’t sell access to its
                quantum computers.

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantum Computer FAQs:</h2>

            <h2>What Company Was Known as "Quantum Computer Services, Inc?”</h2>

            <p>America Online (AOL) was formerly known as Quantum Computer Services Inc. AOL first started as Quantum
                Computer Services in 1985. The company was started by employees from the Control Video Corporation
                (CVC).
            </p><br>

            <h2>How Do You Build a Quantum Computer?</h2>

            <p>Building a quantum computer takes a long time and is expensive. Google has been working on building a
                quantum computer for years and has spent billions of dollars. Google expects to have its quantum
                computer ready by 2029, although IBM hopes to have a 1,000-quibit quantum computer in place by 2023.
            </p><br>

            <h2>How Much Does a Quantum Computer Cost?</h2>

            <p>To build, quantum computers still cost billions. However, China-based Shenzhen SpinQ Technology plans to
                sell a $5,000 desktop quantum computer to consumers for schools and colleges. Last year, it started
                selling a quantum computer for $50,000.
            </p><br>

            <h2>How Fast Is a Quantum Computer?</h2>

            <p>A quantum computer is many times faster than a classical computer and even a supercomputer. Google’s
                quantum computer, Sycamore, is said to have performed a calculation in 200 seconds that one of the
                world’s fastest computers, IBM's Summit, would take 10,000 years to solve.9 IBM disputes this claim,
                saying it would take 2.5 days-still more than 1,000x slower than Google's quantum machine.
            </p><br>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Quantum computing is different from classical computing in how it operates and what it's used for.
                Quantum computing uses qubits, which can be 1 or 0 at the same time, while classical computers use
                transistors, which can only be 1 or 0. As a result, quantum computing is much more powerful and can be
                used for big data analysis or simulations. However, there has not been a commercially developed quantum
                computer yet.
