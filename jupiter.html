        <P>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than
            twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy
            clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red
            Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

            Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of
            Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.</P>

        </P>

        <P>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the
            size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.

            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</P>

        </P>

        <P>Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it
            takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year
            in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).</P>

        <P>Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter
            spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.</P>

        <P>
            <font size="6"><u>Moons:</u></font>
            With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 53
            confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons are named after they are
            confirmed.

            Jupiter's four largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the astronomer
            Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today as the
            Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system. Io is the
            most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even
            bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current
            surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of
            Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.

            <font size="6"><u>Rings:</u></font>
            Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise, as they are composed of
            small, dark particles and are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo
            spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids
            smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons.
        </P>

        <P>
            <font size="6"><u>Formation:</u></font>
            Jupiter took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled
            swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the
            formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar
            system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.
        </P>

        </P>
        <P>About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is
            the fifth planet from the Sun.</P>

        <P>
            <font size="6"><u>Structure:</u></font>
            The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the
            atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives
            Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think
            that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are
            squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast
            rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet's powerful magnetic
            field. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a
            thick, super-hot and dense soup. It could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down
            there, made mostly of iron and silicate minerals (similar to quartz).

        As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a
        spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The
        extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly
        into the planet.</P>

        <P>
            <font size="6"><u>Atmosphere:</u></font>
            Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and spots. The gas planet likely has three
            distinct cloud layers in its "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top
            cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide
            crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.
        </P>

        <P>The vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing
            gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours –
            creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.
        </P>

        <P> With no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept
            by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the
            equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the
            giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot,
            about half the size of its larger cousin.</P>

        <P>
            <font size="6"><u>Magnetosphere:</u></font>
            The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons
            600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of
            Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion
            kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as
            powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric
            charge. Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates them to very
            high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.

            Jupiter's magnetic field also causes some of the solar system's most spectacular aurorae at the planet's
            poles.
